rise1/ -- lot of bad silly synths and perc, but a few good ideas, use of sidepane, mute, note, toggle!!!
rise10/ -- breakbeat exploration, with automatic timeline using custom Task, bien sec, bien sequencé, nice perc, peu developpé
rise11/ -- lot of exploration, few good wobble bass, good drones/nappes, lot of pads, one envfollower
rise12/ -- nice strange dubstep, lot of good idea, could be a track, nice perc fanfare/dub, few nice drones
rise13/ -- lot of pads, dub trance feel, very nice, shifting dronebirds, a feedback, could be a track
rise14/ -- two synth challenge with nice dubby perc, good minimalist sound design, could be a track. two subs
rise15/ -- a try with nice perc and a wobblebass, too fast, aborted, almost not developped, but nice feel anyway
rise16/ -- same try with this particular wobblebass borrowed from another project, but right tempo now, sequenced style
rise17/ -- crepuscule sordide - the track which haunted me so much I don't want to listen again

rise21/ -- dark ambiant two!! more triphop. nice calm bass (distobass), less developped
rise22/ -- nice perc clean and rhytmed break! nice synth but too few developped
rise3/ -- few pads, une ribembelle de global fx avec feedback, suremement plein d'idée pour inspir, les perc marchent pas
rise4/ -- research on granular drones on beat, few pads, good drones (cpu heavy :/)
rise5/ -- random generation of breakbeat/tek, somewhat nice, nice 8bit drones but with a bug, lot of launchlines, pete bien
rise5b/
rise5c/
rise6/ -- just 6 pads, nice loop, too cpu heavy

start/
stone1/ -- nice perc, nice synths! to develop!!! dark spacy dub
stone2/ -- piece of gold, dark ambient, failed dub added in middle, could be a track!!!
