////////// bugs

- envTimeline: when last node is on end line, it's ignored
- Timeline: mouse scroll wheel is broken
- noteTimeline: when viewport is not at top, moving end event doesnt work


////////// TODO
- envTimeline: remove start and end events before processing to make it easier to process
- find a way to remember the viewport when refreshing or recreating the gui
- write an example of view with only one horizontal scroller
- write record event and live play system
- 
- PlayerWrapper could be a Param, when knob is at 0, stop, when at 1, play
- find an architecture to integrate special control which when at 0, stop, when > 1, play and set some param, like amp or morph
