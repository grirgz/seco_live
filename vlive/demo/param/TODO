- StepListDef
- a way to have quicly a gui for step sequencer (button or coin.not) with StepList/StepListDef, best location for adding a cursor
	- maybe add a spec StepSpec for buttons and CoinStepSpec for \unipolar knobs ?
- a way to combine them in a multitrack stepseq
- WindowDef to remember position and size of window + if already open, just .front it
- where is the block gui which add a play/stop button at the left of the block header ?
- FIXME: how i can refresh ListParamLayout.button when changing stepCount ?
	- maybe StepListView ?
		- yes but not button anymore :(


//////////////// use case 1

- create a ndef or pdef
- create a gui to edit its parameters
- create another pdef or ndef
- create a gui to edit its parameters
- add a stepseq with gui
- add a gui to start/stop the two tracks + the stepseq
- add a stepCount control to gui
- add an edit button for each track
- refine the instr editor
- use WindowDef to remember position and size of window + if already open, just .front it


////////////////// refine instr view
- remove target label from each parameter label
	- transform it in a ParamGroupLayout.block
- add a play button

//////////////// what i would like to add
- arbitrary insert effect on a track
- arbitrary send effects on tracks
- a multitrack editor/sequencer
- BIG: can record 8 steps changes in a longer stepseq
- a row of 8 preset buttons with a crossfader in the instr editor
- a preset chooser in the instr editor
- a way to add a custom gui for each instr and have it retrieved in the multitrack editor
